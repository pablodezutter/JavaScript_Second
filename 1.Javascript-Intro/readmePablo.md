## JavaScript Exercises

* set an html page, with some styling
problem with css: incorrect spelling 'lineair'
writing hello world in console, could not see because of a filter in the inspector tool

* var, let and const

"It's a good practice to declare your variables with const. If the value needs to be adjusted later, you change const to let."!!
"where a var variable is available everywhere in you code, a let variable only exists between the curly brackets {} where it was declared" = BLOCK SCOPE 

* arithmetic operators
! write the let in correct order to show in the p!
negative solutions are also shown

* comparison  operators
==, ===, !==, !===
x++: post-increment, it increments the variable after it returns the original value as the value of the expression
++x: this is called pre-increment because it increments the variable before returning it

<->x+=y  is x= x + y 

* conditions
IF:
The code between the {} will only be executed if the condition between the () is TRUE.

#Tuesday 4th of June
 IF (condition){
code block
}

IF the condition is TRUE, else (if the condition is FALSE)

? Can you put new conditions in the second part? - Yes, but only if you put 'if else'. 
'Else' does not need extra conditions.

If you need to use multiple if else statements than use the *SWITCH* statement

* Loops
1. while

runs when it is TRUE
greater than or equals to >=
lesser than or equals to <=

2. For

runs when condition is fullfilled
- Initialization creates a variable to track your position in the loop.
- Condition checks if the loop should be repeated.
- The last argument will be executed at the end of each loop.

! Je wilt de uitkomst van var i tonen, niet van var appelSien
i + text kan een oplossing bieden
? Kan je i gelijk stellen aan een andere var?
Dat hoeft niet. In de console kun je nagaan hoeveel maal de computer het woord meegeeft. 
Dezelfde 'string' wordt NIET onder elkaar geplaatst, dus let op!

* functions
An arrow function consists of the function parameters placed between () followed by an arrow => and the code to execute between {}.
To be able to call the arrow function, we store it in a variable.

* arrays
create an array with [] or (old) new array(), new array(arrayLength);
push things into array (add)
select element by array[1]
pop things from an array (remove last item)

* objects

An object is a collection of key:value pairs that describe the object. This collection is placed between {} and separated by ,.

functions are now called methods
